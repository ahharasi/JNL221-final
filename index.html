        TAP applicants have been steadily declining for many years and COVID accelerated that decline leading to increased awards for each student. New York State’s Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) is a grant that New York residents can apply for through the Higher Education Services Corporation. This program intends to make higher education more accessible to lower income communities across the state.

        COVID caused a standstill in many people’s lives, with many choosing not to go to college as a result. The HESC has more money to give out if less people who are eligible for TAP are applying for it. The graph on the left below shows the change over time for people who individually applied for TAP through the HESC or other means. The graph on the right below includes all recipients, the majority of whom applied as a group according to data.

        Both graphs show a large spike during the 2021 academic year across most income brackets. The difference from before and after the pandemic is at least $400 on average per grant recipient for incomes under $50,000. The graph on the right shows the slow increase in average funding before COVID with an increase from $20 to $100 dollars depending on the year. Higher education seems to be less appealing to potential students who either seek employment right out of high school, attend a technical school, or take another career path.

        Money is a big factor to consider when considering college and while TAP can help, it’s not a life changing grant as the maximum award is up to $5,665, according to the HESC. The graph below shows where students end up using their TAP grants with most of them going to public schools. The grant can certainly help but it doesn’t pay for everything, and that difference is much larger for people who have less opportunities. Having a college degree has been shown to increase an individual’s earnings which could allow them to build up wealth.

        Students who do attend college tend to go to four-year institutions over going to community college. While colleges that grant bachelor’s degrees tend to be larger, community colleges are known to help people who may not have the money for a four-year college’s tuition. While community colleges are becoming more of an acceptable path, it seems that it’s a path that many still choose not to take for some reason.

        It's likely that many people benefited from the increase in TAP grants. However, it could also mean that COVID created a divide between people who were able to attend despite the pandemic and those who could not, which could contribute to the inequality of U.S. society. It could also be the case that COVID caused many people to think if college was worth it, and decided instead to fulfill other high demand positions in the job market that don’t require a college degree.
